# CamBioPy

## Setup

- Clone the repository

- enter the main folder of the repo, run: `pip install -e`

- make sure everything is working with: `pytest`

## Usage

I use these functions in my day to day bioinformatics work, you can import them and use them in other scripts like so:

```
from cambiopy.cunner_name_conversions import vgp2numeric_dict
```

The project is ever growing, and I've not added a comprehensive manual of all the available functions at this time. 
To see what there is to import, have a look through the `/src/cambiopy/` folder!
